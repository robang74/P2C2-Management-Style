                             P²C² Management Style                              
                  Permissive, Persuasive, Confident, Cultivator                 

Permissive:
  - inclusion because everyone is different
  - open dialogue because we all can learn
  - transparency because trust is not an optional
  - delegate because micro-management is an annoying waste
  - flexibility as far as the goals are regularly achieved
  - reasonable N+1 goals, the challenge is in the +1

Persuasive:
  - persuading people to be capable of dealing with the situation
  - acknowledging them that their collaboration is appreciated
  - letting implicit that no one is irreplaceable
  - my door is open, but my time is not gratis
  - ask twice in two separate times, if the decision is critical

Confidant:
  - trust the method, especially when things go wrong
  - patience: sometimes results may take longer to arrive
  - attention: beyond the method, there is the chaos
  - looking forward: once it's done, it's done, learn the lesson
  - courage: do not start with the idea of quitting, but quit if it is useful

Cultivator:
  - everyone has the right to have a personalized growth path
  - every person is different, and therefore, their career path
  - greatly lucky is the manager who promotes their future boss
  - the manager who invites to leave the best ones needs to reflect
